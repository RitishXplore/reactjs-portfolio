## ![Python Automation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Python_Automation-blue) **Python Automation and Web Scraping Projects**
   I worked on large-scale automation and web scraping projects, where we extracted data from 20 different country websites and updated our data warehouse daily. The scraped data was processed and integrated into our database using a Flask API, making it accessible to clients via an internal portal.

   - **Process**: 
     - Data was scraped using Python automation tools and Selenium.
     - The scraped data was processed and added to the database via Flask API.
     - The data was then made available on an internal client portal.

   - **Tech Used**:

## ![Real Estate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Real_Estate-green) **Ray Tax Real Estate Project**
   In this project, I worked on handling large amounts of data in the backend for a real estate platform *Ray Tax*. The platform allows users to reduce their taxes and charges 20% of the reduced tax as profit. I initially worked on the database side using PHP and CakePHP before transitioning the project to a more modern tech stack using the PERN stack.

   - **Process**:
     - Handled large-scale data in MySQL databases.
     - Implemented business logic for tax reduction.
     - Migrated the project to PERN stack for improved automation and scalability.

   - **Tech Used**:
